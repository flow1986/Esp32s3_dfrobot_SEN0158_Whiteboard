ESP32 S3 Cam EYE Whiteboard:
Use lens without IR FIlter on the OV2640 (Remove yourself, or buy a Lens with IR FIlter already removed)


Connect the ESP32 Via USB HID to your device (tested on windows and android).
The ESP32 also connects to your Wifi (add Wifi Credentials bevore compiling)
Use the build in web gui to calibrate and make settings for your whiteboard.


All Code was generated with Microsoft 365 Copilot, beacause i´m am very bad programmer ;-)

Have fun
